    "Tornasole is a new capability of Amazon SageMaker that allows debugging machine learning training. \n",
    "It lets you go beyond just looking at scalars like losses and accuracies during training and gives \n",
    "you full visibility into all tensors 'flowing through the graph' during training. Tornasole helps you to monitor your training in near real time using rules and would provide you alerts, once it has detected inconsistency in training flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Tornasole is a two step process: Saving tensors and Analysis. Let's look at each one of them closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors define the state of the training job at any particular instant in its lifecycle. Tornasole exposes a library which allows you to capture these tensors and save them for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of the tensors emitted is captured by the Tornasole concept called ***Rules***. On a very broad level, \n",
    "a rule is a python code used to detect certain conditions during training. Some of the conditions that a data scientist training a deep learning model may care about are monitoring for gradients getting too large or too small, detecting overfitting, and so on.\n",
    "Tornasole will come pre-packaged with certain rules. Users can write their own rules using the Tornasole APIs.\n",
    "You can also analyze raw tensor data outside of the Rules construct in say, a Sagemaker notebook, using Tornasole's full set of APIs. \n",
    "Please refer [DeveloperGuide_Rules.md](../../../../rules/DeveloperGuide_Rules.md) for more details about analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example guides you through installation of the required components for emitting tensors in a \n",

    "\n",

    "use to process in any way you like. \n",

A rule takes a `base_trial` which refers to the job whose run invokes the rule execution. A rule can optionally look at other jobs as well, passed using the argument `other_trials`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tornasole comes with a set of **First Party rules** (1P rules).\n",
    "You can also write your own rules looking at these 1P rules for inspiration. \n",
    "Refer [DeveloperGuide_Rules.md](../../../../rules/DeveloperGuide_Rules.md) for more on the APIs you can use to write your own rules as well as descriptions for the 1P rules that we provide. \n",
    " \n",
    "Here we will talk about how to use Sagemaker to evalute these rules on the training jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1P Rule \n",
    "If you want to use a 1P rule. Specify the RuleName field with the 1P RuleName, and the rule will be automatically applied. You can pass any parameters accepted by the rule as part of the RuntimeConfigurations dictionary. The argument `base_trial` will automatically be set by SageMaker when executing the rule. The parameter `other_trials` (if taken by the rule) can be passed by passing `other-trials-paths` in the RuntimeConfigurations dictionary. The value for this argument should be `;` separated list of S3 output paths where the tensors for those trials are stored.\n",

    "You need to provide Sagemaker the S3 location of the file which defines your custom rule classes as the value for the field `SourceS3Uri`. Again, you can pass any arguments taken by this rule through the RuntimeConfigurations dictionary.
