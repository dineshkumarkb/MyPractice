    "## Overview\n",
    "Tornasole is a new capability of Amazon SageMaker that allows debugging machine learning training. \n",
    "It lets you go beyond just looking at scalars like losses and accuracies during training and gives \n",
    "you full visibility into all tensors 'flowing through the graph' during training. Tornasole helps you to monitor your training in near real time using rules and would provide you alerts, once it has detected inconsistency in training flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using Tornasole is a two step process: Saving tensors and Analysis. Let's look at each one of them closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving tensors\n",
    "Tensors define the state of the training job at any particular instant in its lifecycle. Tornasole exposes a library which allows you to capture these tensors and save them for analysis. Tornasole is highly customizable to save the tesnsors you want at different frequencies. Refer [DeveloperGuide_TensorFlow](../../DeveloperGuide_TF.md) for details on how to save the tensors you want to save.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of the tensors emitted is captured by the Tornasole concept called ***Rules***. On a very broad level, \n",
    "a rule is a python code used to detect certain conditions during training. Some of the conditions that a data scientist training a deep learning model may care about are monitoring for gradients getting too large or too small, detecting overfitting, and so on.\n",
    "Tornasole will come pre-packaged with certain rules. Users can write their own rules using the Tornasole APIs.\n",
    "You can also analyze raw tensor data outside of the Rules construct in say, a Sagemaker notebook, using Tornasole's full set of APIs. \n",
    "Please refer [DeveloperGuide_Rules](../../../../rules/DeveloperGuide_Rules.md) for more details about analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example guides you through installation of the required components for emitting tensors in a \n",
    "SageMaker training job and applying a rule over the tensors to monitor the live status of the job. \n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, we'll do the installation of required tools which will allow emission of tensors (saving tensors) and application of rules to analyze them. This is only for the purposes of this private beta. Once we do this, we will be ready to use Tornasole."

    "## Training TensorFlow models in SageMaker with Tornasole\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll train a few TensorFlow models in this notebook with Tornasole enabled and monitor the training jobs with Tornasole Rules. This will be done using SageMaker TensorFlow 1.13.1 Container in Script Mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first train a simple example training script [simple.py](../scripts/simple.py) with Tornasole enabled in SageMaker using the SageMaker Estimator API, along with a ExplodingTensor Rule to monitor the training job in realtime. A Tornasole Rule is essentially python code which analyses tensors saved by tornasole and validates some condition. ExplodingTensor rule is a first party (1P) rule provided by Tornasole. During training, Tornasole will capture tensors as specified in its configuration and ExplodingTensor Rule job will monitor whether any tensor exploded (i.e. value became not a number). The rule will emit a cloudwatch event if it finds an exploding tensor during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enabling Tornasole in the script\n",
    "You can see in the script that we have made a couple of simple changes to enable Tornasole. We created a TornasoleHook which we pass when creating a Monitored session, and use this monitored session for training. We passed save_all=True telling the hook to save all tensors in the graph. Note that Tornasole is highly configurable, you can choose exactly what to save. The changes are described in a bit more detail below after we train this example as well as in even more detail in our [Developer Guide for Tensorflow](../../DeveloperGuide_TF.md). \n",
    "\n",
    "We also wrapped the optimizer with Tornasole's optimizer and used this to minimize the loss. This helps Tornasole identify the gradients during training, and changes nothing in the loss minimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tornasole.tensorflow as ts\n",
    "# Wrap the optimizer with Tornasole optimizer to identify gradients\n",
    "optimizer = ts.TornasoleOptimizer(optimizer)  \n",
    "# Ask TORNASOLE to save all tensors. Note: TornasoleHook is highly configurable\n",
    "hook = ts.TornasoleHook(save_all=True)  \n",
    "# pass the hook to hooks parameter of monitored session\n",
    "sess = tf.train.MonitoredSession(hooks=[hook])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker Images with Tornasole\n",
    "We have built SageMaker TensorFlow containers with Tornasole. You can use them from ECR from SageMaker. Here are the links to the images. Please use the image from the appropriate region in which you want your jobs to run."

The argument `base_trial` will automatically be set by SageMaker when executing the rule. The parameter `other_trials` (if taken by the rule) can be passed by passing `other-trials-paths` in the RuntimeConfigurations dictionary.
